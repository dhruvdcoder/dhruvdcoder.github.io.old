		<p class="intro-text">I am a software engineer and this is my personal website.  I am an engineer at the core and I endeavour to find how things work. This is the place where you'd find facts about me, some of my ideas as posts and results of my random musings. I talk about all things that I find interesting; be it linux's elf binaries, concepts in C++17, even Godel's incompleteness theorems. (Page under construction. Stay tuned.) </p>
